# chess-android
A port of the other chess repository to android

## TODO
1. Implement en passant
2. View
  1. ChessBoardView (See [view branch](https://github.com/Tahler/chess-android/tree/view))
    1. displayBoard(Piece[][]) is not called correctly 
    2. Highlight moves
    3. Better image scaling (it's kinda grainy)
    4. Finish unimplemented methods
  2. Create another view holding a ChessBoardView in the center
    1. Maybe it can show a background, player names, captured pieces, etc.
    2. The held ChessBoardView will need to be square
3. Networking
4. Voice Control
5. Achievements
